# WiFiDoor
Uses LAMP structure to access web server information and send data to pins on the raspberry pi. Output pins in this project are connected to a 4 channel relay to open and close a garage door. However, the pins can be connected to anything (lights, AC plug converters, etc.) to activate components.
